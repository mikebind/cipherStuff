# cipherStuff

This project has files related to an enciphered text and its decryption.  The full story is in https://mikebind.github.io/cipherStuff/.  MATLAB code is in the MATLAB subfolder, whereas data files, including the original ciphertext (in Word format in cipherbackup.doc and plain text format in CipherTextWithLineBreaks.txt).  These files are a motley collection of scraps of code from when I was first learning to program up through more recent additions which are a bit more sophisticated, though all pieces here were hastily put together. The more recent work is gone through in a somewhat linear fashion in the MATLAB script named CipherProcessingScript.m. As I worked through the process I kept adding to the bottom of that script, and some notes are contained in there as well. The usage in that script is probably the best guide to what some of the other functions do and how they are used.
