diffs30 predicts shifts at ~40-41, ~73, 124-125,~~163
lets consider the one at 73
Make orientsure and orienttry, linessure, linestry
ixb,ixp = the
dsw,dsk = the
ideas: extend oritext, try to discover dividers...

take in string with spaces, pick off letters, then display in 18 column and plain
text form.  Double space original text so that it can be filled in normally? That's 
probably better.  Place to enter number of alphabets and then the substitution matrix
Display subsmat??  yes and histogram..  Maybe make text file for input? 

% logical flow is lines to orienting to display to substitution.  The key
% to substituting back is to keep the letter indices associated at all
% steps of the process.
