Cipher plans

Keep track of indexing between various representations.  
I always want to know for a given ciphertext character, what is its
index in the original text. Also, I want to know what is the alphabet
number I think it is, and how sure I am of that alphabet number.

I want to have a way of dividing the text into islands where I think 
the interpretation frame is the same.

I want to be able to see the effect of a proposed substitution before I commit to it. 
* Idea: bold? italic?

I believed the period was 18 when there was a consistent frame, so to decode fully, we needed to fill an 18x26 matrix (substitution in 18 alphabets). 

Words of at least 3 letters which are repeated are likely good frame markers. Also there are two repeated 2-word phrases, which are very good markers as well: 
 bj ybf
 bb ixb

Here are repeated WORDS (space word space) assuming spaces are significant:
# Three repetitions
3 vp
3 tia
3 sm
3 odv
3 ncg
3 knr
3 ixp
3 ixb
3 ehl
3 dx
3 bj

# Two repetitions (longest to shortest)
2 qefojxd
2 drsbwkq
2 dnhq
2 wzfz

2 xtu
2 xmq
2 xme
2 xae
2 ybf
2 vkc
2 qtx
2 qly
2 nxy
2 mwt
2 kzr
2 kzd
2 jfu
2 jfg
2 hrs
2 etl
2 dgk
2 bei
2 adh

2 zn
2 wq
2 we
2 um
2 tl
2 tk
2 sc
2 oy
2 kq
2 ke
2 ik
2 ic
2 hy
2 hb
2 gy
2 dl
2 dd
2 cu
2 bv

2 bb

2 n
2 h

# Next I want to know if there are repeated sequences of at least 4 letters (5 is probably better) in the no-space no-punct all-lowercase version
# 5 Letters (only new info)
ddkzd (appears as "dd kzd" and "dd kzdyw")
yeppv (appears in "jkyeppv" and "jwyeppv")
dnhqi (appears in "dnhq iq" and "dnhq ic" very close together(36 char apart))
# 4 Letters (only new info)
pjry (A bit skeptical, appears as "Yyfcgcwpjryo" and "Ipj R.
Yrww", but spacing works out for early couple lines)
odvi ("odv Idx", odv "ilna, very likely, esp as "odv" appears as a word 3x)
fllt ("fllti" and "fllt", very likely)
xmqo ("Xmq owgatp" and "bxm q ocy" sort of unlikely looking to me)
bfon ("rbfon" and "ybf onhuyjt", could be)
ynhn ("ynhn" and "nhzsyn 1890 hn um 1916", maybe)
mmsb ("fhudmms. Bl " and "wqdnxymms bbqkhxug", fairly likely)
tego ("xmtegoiqawhw" and "zbte go", not sure)
vhpk ("yyqzpzvhpkn" and "fvhpkuy", likely?)
plvk ("Mplv ke" and "wplv kmiwt", seems likely)

# Representations:
Original with line breaks?
Original with spacing, punctuation, numbers, and capitalization. 
NoSpacingNoPunct (no numbers, no capitalization either)
Islands (sections of text where I think the NSNP frame is all the same within the same island)

# Approach
Start from words, find start index into NSNP (and therefore into OSP) of each set. Find mod-18 shifts between repetitions? Short distance mod-zero repeats should be initial islands.
